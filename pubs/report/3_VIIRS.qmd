# Exploration of Earth Observation Group Data Sources

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the Earth Observation Group's (EOG) data sources, particularly focusing on the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) datasets: Nighttime Light, Boat Detection, and Night Fire data. These datasets are valuable for monitoring nighttime environmental conditions and human activities, with a range of applications from urban development to environmental assessments and fisheries monitoring.

Each dataset requires a user account for access. While some data are freely accessible, certain high-temporal-resolution or finer-scale data are only available to paid subscribers. Academic institutions may qualify for an annual subscription at no cost; however, using academic access for contract work remains uncertain. Given budget constraints, this exploration is focused on freely available public data accessible through the provided functions.

Data access through EOG is also available programmatically with proper authentication, enabling streamlined integration into automated data pipelines. More details on registration and access setup can be found on the EOG's [registration page](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/register/).

## Data Sources Overview

### VIIRS Nighttime Light (VNL)

The VIIRS Nighttime Light (VNL) data captures artificial light emissions on Earthâ€™s surface, offering insights into human activity patterns, urban development, and infrastructure changes. This data is used extensively in socio-economic, environmental, and urban planning studies.

**Available Data Types:**
- **Annual Composites**: Annual nighttime light data provides a stable overview of long-term trends in light emissions. The data includes various versions; for this exploration, the VCM (Version Controlled Mosaics) configuration is used due to its consistent availability across all years in the dataset. The provided code supports the download of VCM files for each year.

- **Monthly Composites**: Nighttime light data is aggregated monthly, offering insights at a broader time scale suitable for tracking gradual changes in light emissions. Monthly composites are generated from cloud-free Day/Night Band (DNB) observations; however, due to factors like persistent cloud cover in tropical regions and seasonal solar illumination near the poles, some areas have limited or no data coverage for specific months. It is essential for users to check the cloud-free observations file when interpreting monthly data, as a value of zero in the average radiance image does not necessarily mean that no lights were observed.

    The version 1 monthly series is produced globally with two configurations: "vcm" and "vcmsl". The "vcm" configuration excludes data affected by stray light, while the "vcmsl" configuration includes stray-light corrected data for areas where stray light impacts measurements. The "vcmsl" files provide increased data coverage toward the poles but may have reduced data quality. Users should select the configuration best suited to their applications based on data quality requirements.

    Additionally, for each month from 2012 to 2020, the annual V2 lit mask for each year was applied to all months within that year. For example, the 2020 lit mask was applied to all months in 2020. For researchers interested in more detailed masking, updated V2.1 lit masks are available for all years from 2012 to 2021.

- **Nightly Snapshots**: Nightly data captures high-temporal-resolution observations, suitable for applications that require fine-scale temporal granularity. Six file types are available for nightly data, covering aspects like cloud cover, radiance, and sun-filtered radiance. The user can specify the platform, either "NPP" (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) or "J01" (NOAA-20), based on their needs. Each platform provides different observational capabilities, allowing flexibility in data selection for applications sensitive to specific sensor characteristics.

**Code Functionality**:  
The provided code supports automated downloading of VIIRS Nighttime Light data across the following configurations:
- **Annual Data**: Supports VCM configuration with file types such as "average," "median," and "lit_mask."
- **Monthly Data**: Allows users to select either "vcm" or "vcmsl" configuration, with file types like "avg_rade9h" and "cf_cvg."
- **Nightly Data**: Supports multiple file types, such as "cloud_cover" and "rade9d," across both NPP and J01 platforms.

### VIIRS Boat Detection (VBD)

The VIIRS Boat Detection (VBD) data identifies locations of boats based on light emissions in remote or uninhabited areas, providing valuable insights into fishing activities, maritime traffic, and illegal fishing patterns.

**Available Data Types:**
- **Annual, Monthly, and Nightly Boat Detection Records**: These provide counts and locations of detected vessels. Daily data is beneficial for short-term monitoring of vessel activities, particularly in conservation zones or high-traffic areas.

**Code Functionality**:  
The code supports automated download of VIIRS Boat Detection data with options for `annual`, `monthly`, and `nightly` resolutions, allowing for versatile monitoring and analysis of vessel activity data.

### VIIRS Night Fire (VNF)

The VIIRS Night Fire (VNF) data tracks heat sources, including gas flaring, wildfires, and other thermal anomalies, making it useful for environmental monitoring, industrial activity assessments, and disaster response.

**Available Data Types:**
- **Annual Fire Detection Aggregates**: These summaries of thermal anomalies are useful for analyzing general trends in fire and industrial heat source activities across years.
- **Nightly Fire Detection**: This includes temperature, radiant heat, and size of heat sources, with data granularity crucial for real-time monitoring of fire events. Currently, freely available nightly data is limited to version 4.0 for dates in 2023 and 2024.

**Code Functionality**:  
The code supports automated downloading of VIIRS Night Fire data for both `annual` aggregates and `nightly` snapshots for the years 2023 and 2024. This flexibility allows for long-term analysis as well as near real-time event monitoring.

## Summary

Access to EOG's VIIRS datasets provides critical insights into environmental and human activities. Our data exploration focuses on the publicly accessible annual, monthly, and nightly datasets, where available, with an ongoing evaluation of potential academic access for broader data utility. Findings and documentation from this exploration will be included in the project report, informing future decisions on the feasibility of more granular data acquisition under different contractual or academic arrangements.
