##### About This Application

This web app provides access to geospatial threat layers for marine bird conservation in Atlantic Canada. Developed for Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), it supports Ocean Protection Plan and Marine Spatial Planning initiatives by visualizing threats such as oil pollution, vessel traffic, offshore infrastructure, and light pollution.

##### Key Features

- **Browse & Filter**: Threat layers by category, time, and type  
- **Visualize**: Layers on interactive maps with legends and color scales  
- **Combine**: Layers using sum, mean, max, min, or standard deviation  
- **Process**: Crop and resample data to custom extents  
- **Export**: Download selected or processed layers with metadata  

##### Data Sources

Layers are derived from:
