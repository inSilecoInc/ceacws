    "section": "1.1 Background",
    "text": "1.1 Background\nThe Migratory Birds Regulations, under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, strictly prohibit the harming of migratory birds; however coastal and marine birds are subject to injury and death in Canada due to multiple threats in the marine environment. Under the Ocean Protection Plan (OPP) and the Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) initiatives, ECCC is coordinating efforts to improve information on the spatiotemporal distribution and overlap of coastal and marine birds with threats at sea, such as potential oil spills from industrial infrastructure and marine traffic. The OPP initiative specifically supports the collation and generation of scientific data and knowledge products for integration into marine response plans, the effectiveness of which will be greatly increased if cumulative effects of all known stressors are considered.\nOf the wide range of coastal and marine bird species which breed and forage in the waters around the Atlantic Provinces, many migrate long distances to their overwintering areas so are exposed to additional threats beyond Canada’s jurisdiction, adding to the complexity of understanding cumulative effects on species for which Canada has conservation and stewardship responsibility. For example, Canada hosts &gt;90% of the Atlantic-basin breeding population of the globally threatened Leach’s Storm-Petrel (listed as threatened by Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) which regularly forage beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone and migrate as far as the waters off southern Africa. With foresight to the development of a Recovery Strategy for this species and in support of OPP and MSP initiatives, ECCC is currently leading a study to better understand habitat use and overlap with anthropogenic threats for this species throughout the annual cycle.\nOf particular interest is improving understanding of the nature (if, when, how) and consequences of seabird interactions with offshore vessel traffic and the offshore oil and gas industry. Seabird interactions with offshore oil and gas platforms is a long-standing issue in the Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia offshore. In a 2012 Auditor General report (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development (CESD) 2012) it was noted “Exhibit 1.5. The effects of offshore projects on seabirds need to be better understood”. Within the OPP, ECCC is responsible for informing preparedness, planning and response with respect to migratory birds which requires an understanding of the where and when marine birds are most at risk to threats like oil pollution, vessel traffic, and light pollution.\nThis contract will develop spatial-temporal risk layers relevant to seabird conservation within Canada’s EEZ and abroad. Specifically, this work will develop threats layers related to oil pollution, oil and gas infrastructure, vessel traffic, and light pollution.",

    "text": "4.4 Automatic Identification System (AIS) Shipping Data\nThe Automatic Identification System (AIS) (Transports Canada, 2023) collects dynamic positional data from ships to enhance maritime safety, monitor environmental impacts, and facilitate shipping analyses. This dataset, provided by Transport Canada, focuses on 2023 vessel movements across Atlantic Canada. The AIS data provides dynamic vessel information, including position, speed, and course, captured through terrestrial, satellite, and tier-based receivers (Table 4.6). The AIS data shared includes both terrestrial and satellite AIS messages, fused to minimize spatial and temporal gaps and stored as compressed parquet files. The data shared also contains pre-processed tracklines as a geodatabase. However, we used the raw AIS positional data to recreate tracklines for the purposes of this project to allow for more temporal granularity.

(2023):\n\nData Extraction\n\nAIS data was extracted from compressed archive files and loaded into memory using efficient tools such as the arrow (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=arrow) and vroom (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vroom) R packages. This ensured scalability given the dataset size, which often exceeds 10GB annually.\n\nInitial Data Cleaning\n\nRaw AIS data was filtered to remove invalid records:\n\nOnly positions with valid MMSI values (201000000–775999999) were retained.\nSOG values were restricted to the range 0.1–100 knots to remove implausible speeds.\n\n\nDay/Night Classification\n\nUsing the suncalc R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/suncalc/index.html), each AIS position was classified as daytime or nighttime. The classification was based on local sunrise and sunset times at each position, ensuring alignment with the UTC timestamp.\n\nTrackline Generation\n\nTracklines were created by:\n\nSorting AIS data by MMSI and timestamp.\nCalculating distances between consecutive positions using geodesic measurements.\nSplitting movements into separate tracks when:\n\nThe distance exceeded 50 nautical miles.\nThe time interval between positions exceeded 300 minutes.\n\nFurther segmenting tracklines to differentiate between daytime and nighttime navigation.\n\n\nTrackline Attributes\n\nAdditional attributes were calculated for each trackline to facilitate further analysis:\n\nAverage and Maximum Speeds: Derived from AIS speed data.\nNumber of Positions: Total AIS messages contributing to the trackline.\nElapsed Hours: Duration of the trackline.\nTrack Length: Computed in kilometers using geodesic measurements.\nDaytime Classification: Indicates whether the trackline occurred during the day, night, or a mix of both.\n\n\nPost-Processing\n\nErratic tracklines were flagged and removed using heuristic thresholds:\n\nExtremely short tracks (&lt;100 meters).\nUnrealistic average speeds (&lt;0.3 knots or &gt;100 km/h).\nSpeeds exceeding vessel-type-specific thresholds:\n30 km/h for pleasure vessels and special ships.\n35 km/h for fishing and tug vessels.\n40 km/h for all other vessel types.\n\nTracklines identified as spoofing were excluded from further analyses.\n\nOutput\n\nThe cleaned tracklines were exported as monthly parquet files (.parquet). Each file contains the processed AIS points with vessel information and the necessary information to differentiate individual tracks and whether tracks are during daytime or nighttime. Each point includes relevant attributes, such as speed, duration, and daytime classification, enabling detailed analyses of vessel movements across Canadian waters (Table 4.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.7: Columns (attributes) associated with the AIS positional points processed from the raw parquet files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn_Name\nDescription\nInformation\nData_Type\n\n\n\n\nmmsi\nMaritime Mobile Service Identity\n9-digit identifier assigned to a vessel\nNumeric\n\n\nlatitude\nLatitude of the AIS positional point in decimal degrees\nRecorded in WGS 84 (EPSG:4326)\nNumeric\n\n\nlongitude\nLongitude of the AIS positional point in decimal degrees\nRecorded in WGS 84 (EPSG:4326)\nNumeric\n\n\nsog\nSpeed over ground at the AIS positional point\nMeasured in knots converted to kilometers per hour\nNumeric\n\n\nymd_hms\nTimestamp of the AIS positional point in UTC\nRecorded in POSIXct format with timezone UTC\nPOSIXct\n\n\ndate\nDate corresponding to the AIS positional point\nDerived from the timestamp for easier grouping and filtering\nDate\n\n\nday_or_night\nClassification of the AIS positional point as day or night\nDerived using sunrise and sunset times from solar calculations\nCharacter\n\n\ndist_miles\nDistance (in miles) between consecutive AIS positional points\nCalculated using geodetic distance between successive points\nNumeric\n\n\ntime_diff\nTime difference (in minutes) between consecutive AIS positional points\nDifference between timestamps of successive points\nNumeric\n\n\nnew_track\nFlag indicating whether a new trackline is initiated at the point\nDetermined based on distance or time thresholds for new tracklines\nLogical\n\n\ntrack_id\nUnique identifier for each trackline within a ship’s movement\nGenerated using the cumulative sum of new_track flags\nInteger\n\n\nday_night_segment\nUnique identifier for segments of tracklines split by day or night\nCalculated to split tracklines into day and night segments\nInteger",

VIIRS collects visible and infrared imagery and radiometric measurements, supporting applications such as environmental monitoring, weather forecasting, and maritime surveillance, including boat detection.\n\n4.5.1 VIIRS Boat Detection (VBD) Dataset\nThe VIIRS Boat Detection (VBD) Dataset (Earth Observation Group, Payne Institute for Public Policy, 2024a) provides nightly global data on boat detections based on radiance observations captured by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This dataset is widely used for maritime surveillance, tracking vessel activity, and monitoring illegal fishing. The raw data includes detections with associated radiance, confidence metrics, and spatial coordinates (Table 4.8). The data was acquired for the years 2020–2023 and pre-processed to facilitate further analysis of vessel patterns within the Canadian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

While these indices were not directly applied in the current processing pipeline, they could be used for further refining data quality and reducing false positives:\n\nSMI: Measures the signal strength relative to the mean radiance value in the surrounding area. Higher values indicate stronger, more distinct detections.\nSHI: Measures the signal strength relative to a high radiance threshold, helping to exclude detections influenced by bright land-based lights or other high-radiance sources.\n\nFuture iterations of the pipeline could incorporate these metrics for scenarios requiring stricter detection thresholds, such as high-confidence studies of vessel activity in heavily lit areas.\n\n\n\n4.5.2 VIIRS Night Fire (VNF) Dataset\nThe VIIRS Night Fire (VNF) Dataset (Earth Observation Group, Payne Institute for Public Policy, 2024b; Elvidge et al., 2013b) provides nightly and annual global thermal anomaly detections captured by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This dataset is commonly used for monitoring gas flares, wildfires, industrial emissions, and other heat sources. The raw data includes processed radiance-derived fields (e.g., temperature and radiant heat indices), quality flags for detection confidence, spatial coordinates, and emitter-specific information. Table 4.9 presents a subset of available attributes for the nightly data that were selected for their relevance to this project.\nIn addition to the nightly VNF dataset, the annual VNF data from 2017 to 2023 was harvested. This dataset provides aggregated yearly thermal anomaly detections, including gas flares, with data specific to Canada.

This dataset is widely used for analyzing human activity, urbanization, and environmental monitoring. The monthly VNL data includes radiance measures aggregated over time, with options for stray-light corrected data and various file types, including cloud-free composites and coverage metrics.\nFor this analysis, the file type avg_rade9h was selected, which represents the average radiance values over the specified temporal period, expressed in nanowatts per square centimeter per steradian (nW/cm²/sr). This file type is particularly suited for analyzing overall light intensity while excluding temporary anomalies. The data was obtained using the vcm configuration, which excludes stray light, ensuring higher data accuracy in regions with minimal artificial light. Additionally, the data was sourced from the j01 platform, representing the NOAA-20 satellite, part of the VIIRS suite, which provides enhanced coverage and resolution compared to earlier satellites.\nThe raw raster files were downloaded in GeoTIFF format and processed to focus on the Canadian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Processing involved loading the rasters, cropping them to a bounding box defined by the coordinates (-141, 40, -50, 85), and exporting each monthly raster as a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG). This format allows for efficient storage, faster data access, and better interoperability with modern geospatial tools, particularly for web-based or cloud-hosted applications. The processed COGs retain the original resolution and include internal overviews for optimized rendering.\n\n4.5.3.1 Data Overview\n\nSource: Earth Observation Group, Payne Institute for Public Policy\nAccessibility: Restricted access, credentials required\nData Type: GeoTIFF files (.tif.gz)\nCoverage: Global\nTemporal Resolution: Monthly\nProcessing Script: prc_viirs_night_light.R\nOutput File: viirs_night_light.tif",

    "text": "4.1 Petroleum Pollution Based on Past Incidents\nThe objective was to assess the risk associated with petroleum incidents by evaluating the frequency of past incidents at specific locations over a defined period. Ideally, a more detailed approach would model the diffusion of each spill based on factors such as total volume, substance type, and local or regional currents to estimate the likely spread of each event. However, this level of detail was beyond the scope of the current study. Given the retrospective nature of the dataset and its focus on historical rather than predictive risk, we chose a simplified approach. Each recorded or probable incident was treated as an individual, discrete event in the dataset to characterize exposure to petroleum-related incidents.\nThis threat layer was constructed using the ISTOP, NEEC, and NASP datasets. Each dataset was processed to create spatially and temporally explicit threat layers:\nEach dataset was clipped to the boundary of the area of interest (Section 1.3). Temporal information was standardized, with incident dates grouped by month. The datasets were rasterized using the study grid, with each grid cell representing the count of overlapping incidents for a given temporal period divided by the period covered by each dataset, resulting in an assessment in number of events per year. For the NEEC dataset, additional threat layers were created based on the substance classification (e.g., liquid with oil sheen, liquid without oil sheen, unknown). The ISTOP and NASP datasets were similarly grouped to create monthly raster layers of incident density. We also created monthly rasters combining all the datasets together. The resulting raster layers provide spatially explicit representations of petroleum pollution incidents, highlighting areas of greater historical exposure.\nTable 4.1: Volume categories and buffer size selected to transform incident as point locations to area of exposure from\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolume (L)\nBuffer size (m)\n\n\n\n\n[0, 100]\n250\n\n\n[100, 1000]\n500\n\n\n[1000, 10000]\n1000\n\n\n[10000+ [\n2000",

    "text": "4.2 Offshore Petroleum\n\n4.2.1 Offshore Petroleum Activities\nThe offshore petroleum activity threat layers were developed to assess spatial exposure to petroleum-related industrial activities within the defined study area. This analysis integrates spatial data on petroleum operations from Newfoundland Section 4.2.1 and Nova Scotia Section 4.2.2. Data preparation involved processing point and polygon features from the harvested datasets. Point geometries were buffered by 500 meters to approximate their spatial influence, while polygon geometries were used as-is. The combined dataset was clipped to the boundary of the area of interest and grouped by classification (Table 4.2) and status categories (Table 4.3). Spatial features were grouped into discrete threat layers using union operations to consolidate overlapping geometries and identify areas where activities occurred as presence-absence. To quantify exposure, the threat layers were rasterized using the study grid (Section 1.3). Each cell in the raster represents the count of overlapping features for a given combination of classification and status. This process generated a series of spatially explicit raster layers, which were exported as geospatial files for further use.\n\nProcessing Script: ana_offshore_petroleum_activity.R\nOutput File(s): Rasterized layers stored in workspace/data/analyzed/offshore_petroleum_activity-1.0.0/.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Offshore Petroleum Platforms\nThe offshore petroleum platform threat layers were created using the VIIRS Night Fire (VNF) dataset (Section 4.5.2), with separate analyses for monthly and annual data. These layers quantify spatial and temporal variations in flaring activity associated with offshore petroleum platforms, providing insight into their environmental footprint.\n\n4.2.2.1 Annual Layers\nThe annual VNF dataset was used to generate rasterized layers summarizing flaring activity by year. Each annual dataset contains spatial information on platform locations, including the average temperature of flares (avg_temp_k). The following steps were applied to create the annual threat layers:\n\nData Preparation: The annual VNF dataset was filtered to retain only records within the area of interest (Section 1.3).\nAggregation: Flaring activity was grouped by year to calculate annual summaries of total heat output (total_heat) at each platform location.\nRasterization: The annual flaring data was rasterized using the study grid, with each grid cell containing the sum of total_heat values for all platforms in that cell for a given year.\nExport: Rasterized layers were exported as geospatial files, with one raster file generated for each year.\n\nThe resulting layers provide annual snapshots of flaring activity.\n\nProcessing Script: ana_offshore_petroleum_platform_annual.R\nOutput Files: Rasterized annual layers stored in workspace/data/analyzed/offshore_petroleum_platform_annual-1.0.0/.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Monthly Layers\nThe monthly VNF dataset was used to generate high-resolution temporal layers, summarizing flaring activity at a monthly level. These layers provide finer granularity in monitoring platform activity. It should be noted that only data for the year 2023 are available. The following steps were applied to create the monthly threat layers:\n\nData Preparation: The monthly VNF dataset was filtered to retain only records flagged as likely_flare and located within the area of interest (Section 1.3).\nTemporal Grouping: Flaring activity was grouped by month, with the total_heat value aggregated for each month.\nRasterization: For each month, flaring data was rasterized onto the study grid, with cell values representing the sum of total_heat values for all platforms within that cell.\nExport: Rasterized layers were exported as geospatial files, with one raster file generated for each month.\n\nThe monthly layers allow for detailed temporal analyses of flaring activity.\n\nProcessing Script: ana_offshore_petroleum_platform_monthly.R\nOutput Files: Rasterized monthly layers stored in workspace/data/analyzed/offshore_petroleum_platform_monthly-1.0.0/.",

This analysis utilizes Automatic Identification System (AIS) data (Section 4.4). The following processing steps were used to create this threat layer, but refer to Section 4.4 for more information on AIS data processing:\n\nData Preparation:\n\nAIS data for ship locations and movements were ingested in Parquet format and pre-processed to ensure compatibility with the study grid.\nAuxiliary information on vessel types was included by merging with a reference dataset containing vessel classification (ntype).\n\nSpatial Filtering:\n\nData points were filtered to retain only those within the area of interest, as defined by its bounding box.\nVessel movements were further processed to create continuous tracklines by connecting sequential AIS points for individual vessels.\n\nTemporal Grouping:\n\nVessel tracklines were grouped by month, allowing for the calculation of monthly ship traffic densities.\n\nDensity Calculation:\n\nShip densities were calculated by rasterizing the trackline data onto the study grid. For each grid cell, the number of unique vessel occurrences was normalized by the number of days in the corresponding month to obtain a density assessment in number of ships per month in each grid cell.\n\nVessel Type-Specific Analysis:\n\nShip densities were categorized by vessel type (ntype), creating separate layers for different vessel classes.\n\nExport:\n\nRasterized ship density layers were exported as geospatial files, with separate files generated for each month and vessel type.\n\n\nThe ship-based pollution risk layer provides spatially and temporally explicit representations of shipping activity, highlighting areas with higher densities of vessel traffic.

Two distinct data sources were utilized to create this layer: Automatic Identification System (AIS) data filtered for nighttime activities and VIIRS Boat Detection (VBD) data.\n\n4.5.2.1 Nighttime Shipping Activities Using AIS Data\nThis layer builds on the methods described in section Section 4.5.1 but focuses specifically on nighttime shipping activities. The following key differences in processing were applied:\n\nNighttime Filtering: AIS data was filtered to retain only ship positions recorded during nighttime, as determined by the day_or_night field in the processed AIS dataset (see Section 4.4).\nTrackline Creation: Tracklines were constructed using only nighttime data points, maintaining the methodology described previously.\nDensity Calculation: The density of nighttime shipping activities was calculated and normalized by the number of nights in each month, resulting in monthly raster layers providing the number of ships per month in each grid cell.\n\nThis layer highlights areas with intense nighttime shipping activities, reflecting potential light pollution from ship-based operations.\n\nProcessing Script: ana_shipping_night_light_density.R\nOutput Files: Rasterized monthly layers stored in workspace/data/analyzed/shipping_night_light_intensity_density-1.0.0/.\n\n\n\n4.5.2.2 Nighttime Ship Light Detection Using VBD Data\nThe second approach utilized VIIRS Boat Detection (VBD) data (Section 4.5.1), which directly measures the radiance of lights detected from boats at night. The following steps were applied:\n\nData Preparation: The VBD dataset was filtered to include only observations within the area of interest.\nTemporal Grouping: Observations were grouped by month, with radiance values aggregated for each month.\nRasterization: Monthly radiance values were rasterized onto the study grid. Each grid cell contains the sum of radiance values for all detected boats within that cell divided by the number of years of data harvested, resulting in total radiance per year in each grid cell.\nMasking and Export: Rasterized layers were masked to the area of interest and exported as monthly geospatial files.\n\nThis layer provides a direct measurement of ship light emissions, offering a complementary perspective to the AIS-derived night lights layer.\n\nProcessing Script: ana_ship_light_detection.R\nOutput Files: Rasterized monthly layers stored in workspace/data/analyzed/ship_light_detection-1.0.0/.",

    "text": "4.6 Commercial Fisheries\nThe fisheries intensity threat layer quantifies the spatial and temporal distribution of fishing activities in the study area, using commercial fisheries logbook data (Section 4.6). This analysis focuses on estimating fishing pressure for different gear types, target species, and month-year combinations. The following processing steps were used to create this threat layer:\n\nData Preparation:\n\nLogbook data (logbooks.parquet) was ingested, alongside auxiliary datasets for gear codes (gear.csv) and species information (species.csv).\nData was cleaned to ensure completeness and compatibility with the study area grid. Missing values in critical fields, such as nb_engin (number of gear) and eff_hre (effort hours), were addressed with appropriate default values.\nDepth was standardized, converting depth classes (cl_prof) into mean depths in fathoms, and depth values were further converted into meters.\n\nGear Classification:\n\nGear codes were classified into four main types (see Table 4.2):\n\nGillnet: Includes codes for various gillnet fishing configurations.\nLongline: Differentiates longline fishing but does not yet distinguish between pelagic and demersal types.\nTrawl: Covers various trawling techniques.\nPurse Seine: Identified separately from other seine nets.\n\nThis classification allowed for the calculation of fishing intensity per gear type.\n\nSpecies Traits and Target Species:\n\nSpecies traits related to their environment (e.g., pelagic, demersal) were retrieved and linked to target species in the logbook data. This will support future classification of longline and trawl fishing into pelagic and demersal categories.\nLogbook entries without valid target species (prespvis) or fishing events (nb_engin, effort_days) were excluded.\n\nIntensity Calculation:\n\nGillnet Fishing: Fishing pressure was calculated as the product of the number of nets set (nb_engin) and soak time in days (effort_days), resulting in an assessment in number of nets per day. For depths greater than 200 m, soak time was limited to 1 hour to account for bird exposure risk.\nLongline Fishing: Fishing pressure was estimated based on the number of hooks set (nb_engin) and soak time in days (effort_days), resulting in an assessment in number of hooks set per day. Future refinements will incorporate target species to classify longline sets as pelagic or demersal.\nTrawl Fishing: Fishing pressure was estimated based on the number of trawls (nb_engin) and fishing effort in days (effort_days), resulting in an assessment in number of trawling events per day. Future refinements will incorporate target species to classify longline sets as midwater or demersal.\nPurse Seine Fishing: Fishing pressure was calculated as the product of the number of seines set

Spatial data points were rasterized onto the study grid to produce spatially explicit layers.\nSeparate raster layers were generated for each gear type and month-year combination, representing the sum of fishing pressure (e.g., number of nets fished per day) in each grid cell, thus providing a number per month.\n\n\n\n4.6.1 Exported Layers and Outputs\nThe fisheries intensity threat layer provides detailed spatial and temporal representations of fishing activity.
