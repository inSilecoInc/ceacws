    "section": "1.1 Background",
    "text": "1.1 Background\nThe Migratory Birds Regulations, under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, strictly prohibit the harming of migratory birds; however coastal and marine birds are subject to injury and death in Canada due to multiple threats in the marine environment. Under the Ocean Protection Plan (OPP) and the Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) initiatives, ECCC is coordinating efforts to improve information on the spatiotemporal distribution and overlap of coastal and marine birds with threats at sea, such as potential oil spills from industrial infrastructure and marine traffic. The OPP initiative specifically supports the collation and generation of scientific data and knowledge products for integration into marine response plans, the effectiveness of which will be greatly increased if cumulative effects of all known stressors are considered.\nOf the wide range of coastal and marine bird species which breed and forage in the waters around the Atlantic Provinces, many migrate long distances to their overwintering areas so are exposed to additional threats beyond Canada’s jurisdiction, adding to the complexity of understanding cumulative effects on species for which Canada has conservation and stewardship responsibility. For example, Canada hosts &gt;90% of the Atlantic-basin breeding population of the globally threatened Leach’s Storm-Petrel (listed as threatened by Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) which regularly forage beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone and migrate as far as the waters off southern Africa. With foresight to the development of a Recovery Strategy for this species and in support of OPP and MSP initiatives, ECCC is currently leading a study to better understand habitat use and overlap with anthropogenic threats for this species throughout the annual cycle.\nOf particular interest is improving understanding of the nature (if, when, how) and consequences of seabird interactions with offshore vessel traffic and the offshore oil and gas industry. Seabird interactions with offshore oil and gas platforms is a long-standing issue in the Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia offshore. In a 2012 Auditor General report (Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development (CESD) 2012) it was noted “Exhibit 1.5. The effects of offshore projects on seabirds need to be better understood”. Within the OPP, ECCC is responsible for informing preparedness, planning and response with respect to migratory birds which requires an understanding of the where and when marine birds are most at risk to threats like oil pollution, vessel traffic, and light pollution.\nThis contract will develop spatial-temporal risk layers relevant to seabird conservation within Canada’s EEZ and abroad. Specifically, this work will develop threats layers related to oil pollution, oil and gas infrastructure, vessel traffic, and light pollution.",

    "section": "1.4 Data management and reproducibility",
    "text": "1.4 Data management and reproducibility\nThe aim of database management is to ensure the transparency and reproducibility of the project. Our approach is based on the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles, which seek to ensure that the data used are discoverable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. We therefore use programming tools, in particular the language R1. There are a number of advantages to using programming tools such as ArcGIS2. They offer great flexibility, enabling us to very quickly integrate changes or new considerations without having to redo a number of steps in a complex process. This flexibility is not limited to analysis, since all steps of a project, from the integration of raw data to the production of reports, can be integrated and easily modified. It is then an easy matter to integrate comments or new recommendations arising from engagement processes, for example.\nWe also use GitHub3, a version control tool for the documentation, quality control, and development/change history of programming elements relevant to the entire project. We created a publicly available research compendium called ceacws that provides the collection of all parts of our research project including text, figures, data, and code that ensures reproducibility of the study.\nWhile not including the data directly, the research compendium contains all the resources making it possible to access and transform the raw data and prepare the threat layers for this project. It also contains – or will contain – the code creating figures, tables and this report. Only sensitive data for which confidentiality agreements have been signed remain inaccessible; still, these are stored on Google Cloud Storage in a secure bucket that can be accessed programmatically with an access key. This ensures that the whole project remains fully reproducible even if access to some data is limited.\nThe research compendium relies on another R package called pipedat, which provides analytical pipelines to access, load, and format a variety of data from multiple sources programmatically. The goal of pipedat is to enhance the capacity scientists, planners and the wider public to prepare and perform complex and reproducible ecosystem-scale assessments requiring the integration of multiple spatial datasets such as cumulative effects assessments in the context of ecosystem-based management, and Marxan analyses for the establishment of individual and networks of MPAs. While the analytical pipelines used to fetch and format the data for this project are available in this research compendium, their latest version and execution are performed with pipedat.",

    "text": "5 Petroleum pollution based on past incidents\nThe objective was to assess the risk associated with petroleum incidents by evaluating the frequency of past incidents at specific locations over a defined period. Ideally, a more detailed approach would model the diffusion of each spill based on factors such as total volume, substance type, and local or regional currents to estimate the likely spread of each event. However, this level of detail was beyond the scope of the current study. Given the retrospective nature of the dataset and its focus on historical rather than predictive risk, we chose a simplified approach. Each recorded or probable incident was treated as an individual, discrete event in the dataset to characterize exposure to petroleum-related incidents.\nThis threat layer was constructed using the ISTOP, NEEC and NASP datasets. Each dataset was processed to create spatially and temporally explicit threat layers.\nFor the ISTOP dataset, we retained only categories 1A (possible oil with a clearly associated target), 1B (possible oil with a target within 50 km), and 2 (possible oil without an identifiable source), resulting in 123 usable observations. Since the ISTOP data already includes polygons representing areas of exposure, these polygons were directly utilized as pollution events in the analysis.\nThe NASP data was refined by removing records with missing coordinates, yielding 3403 usable observations. Each NASP incident is represented as a point with latitude/longitude coordinates and includes spill volumes in liters. Since this dataset lacks defined surface areas, we inferred exposure areas by categorizing spill volumes and applying a variable buffer around each point based on the reported volume (Table 5.1).\nThe NEEC dataset underwent extensive filtering, including the removal of records with empty coordinates, selection of the highest quantity for multi-substance spills, and exclusion of terms like “mvi” or “furnace oil.” The final dataset includes 1663 observations within 1 km of the coastline. Similar to the NASP data, the NEEC incidents are represented as points with latitude/longitude coordinates and spill volumes. The same approach of categorizing by volume and buffering each point was applied to the NEEC data (Table 5.1). Additionally, NEEC data was classified by substance type, considering both chemical state (solid, liquid, gas) and the presence of an oil sheen. After filtering, incidents were categorized into liquid with oil sheen (1331), liquid without oil sheen (4), or unknown 328.These categories were retained to create distinct threat layers based on substance type.\nThe full details of the data processing and analytical approach used is available in the script ana_petroleum_pollution_incidents.R.\n\nProcessing Script: ana_petroleum_pollution_incidents.R\nOutput File: petroleum_pollution_incidents.gpkg\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Volume categories and buffer size selected to transform incident as point locations to area of exposure from\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolume (L)\nBuffer size (m)\n\n\n\n\n[0, 100]\n500\n\n\n[100, 1000]\n2000\n\n\n[1000, 10000]\n3000\n\n\n[10000+ [\n5000",
