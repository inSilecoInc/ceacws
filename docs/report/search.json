Work must be completed by 31 March 2024*.\nGenerate oiling and vessel disturbance threat layers. The proponent will format and analyze spatiotemporal data to produce oiling and vessel disturbance threat layers as indicated in Table 1, Task 2, documenting reproducible workflows. Work must be completed by 31 March 2024*.\nSource data required to generate threat layers for Task 4. The proponent will assess and acquire the following datasets required for the analyses in Task 4, documenting reproducible workflows whenever possible. Work must be completed by 31 July 2024*.\nGenerate light-based threat layers. The proponent will format and analyze spatiotemporal data to produce light attraction threat layers as indicated in Table 1, Task 4, documenting reproducible workflows. Work must be completed by 31 July 2024*.\n\n\nThe proponent will not be held responsible for timely delivery of a given task if the data required to complete that task are not delivered to them in timely manner – provided the proponent requested data access/delivery during Year 1 of the contract and requested a status update on the request at least once.",
