  description: |
    This dataset contains shapefiles representing areas of consideration for offshore wind development in Canada. 
    These areas have been identified in the Wind Regional Assessmentâ€™s Interim Report for each province.
    - **Nova Scotia**: Potential Future Development Areas (PFDA)
    - **Newfoundland**: Preliminary Offshore Wind Licensing Areas (PLA)
    These datasets are expected to become publicly available soon through the Canadian Impact Assessment Registry and the Open Government Portal.
