  description: "The National Aerial Surveillance Program (NASP) is a surveillance program led by Transport Canada that operates across the country to detect pollution through aerial surveys. Its goals are to prevent pollution in our waters, protect our marine environment and endangered marine life, and ensure a safe and efficient transportation industry along our massive and varied coastlines. The data provided covers oil pollution detections for the Atlantic region between April 2012 and March 2023. A total of 3578 incidents were recorded, with 3572 usable observations after cleaning, which removed missing spill volumes."
